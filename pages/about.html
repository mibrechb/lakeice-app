  <h2>About</h2>
  <p>
    This lake ice platform provides access to satellite-based observations of lake ice cover across the European Alps.
    It allows users to explore variations in the timing and duration of lake cycles during the last decade.
    The application is designed as an open and transparent tool to share results from the monitoring framework developed
    in Brechbühler et al. (in prepartion).

    <h3>Why monitor lake ice?</h3>
    <p>Lake ice cover provides a variety of ecological and cultural ecosystem services, and its loss can lead to
      consequences such as reduced water quality, oxygen depletion, and increased algal blooms. With
      increasing pressure from climate change, the timing of seasonal lake ice freeze-up and break-up — referred to as
      lake ice phenology — is shifting. Research has shown that lakes across the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing
      progressively earlier ice-off dates, later ice-on dates, and shorter ice durations, with some lakes failing to
      freeze entirely. Due to its critical importance in characterizing the Earth's climate, lake ice cover has been
        designated by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as one of the <a href="https://gcos.wmo.int/site/global-climate-observing-system-gcos/essential-climate-variables/about-essential-climate-variables" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Essential Climate Variables</a>, making its
      measurement vital for understanding and predicting the Earth’s climate.</p>

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>Our approach utilizes optical, thermal, and active microwave satellite imagery to detect lake ice from
        space. Combining data from multiple sensors with high spatial resolution (20–30 meters), the system provides a
        monitoring approach with sub-weekly to daily observations. A complete processing chain has been implemented to
        extract lake ice coverage and phenology for lakes as small as 0.05 km² using machine learning
        classification models.</p>

    <h3>Where to access the data?</h3>
    <p>The lake ice data is accessible through our web application in the Map tab, which allows users to explore lake
      ice coverage and
      phenological event dates for over 1,200 lakes across the European Alps. The full published dataset can be accessed
      at XXX.

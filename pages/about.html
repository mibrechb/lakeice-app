    <h3>Why monitor lake ice?</h3>
    <p>Lake ice cover provides a variety of ecological and cultural ecosystem services, and its loss can lead to ecological consequences such as reduced water quality, oxygen depletion, and increased algal blooms. With increasing pressure from climate change, the timing of seasonal lake ice freeze-up and break-up—referred to as lake ice phenology (LIP)—is shifting. Research shows that lakes across the Northern Hemisphere are experiencing progressively earlier ice-off dates, later ice-on dates, and shorter ice durations, with some lakes failing to freeze entirely. Due to its critical importance in characterizing the Earth's climate, lake ice cover has been designated by the Global Climate Observing System (GCOS) as one of the Essential Climate Variables, making its measurement vital for understanding and predicting the Earth’s climate.</p>

      <h3>How does it work?</h3>
      <p>We have developed an extensive monitoring system for the European Alps using a multi-sensor remote sensing approach. By utilizing optical, thermal, and active microwave satellite imagery, lake ice can be detected from space. Combining data from multiple sensors with high spatial resolution (20–30 meters), the system provides a monitoring approach with sub-weekly to daily observations. A complete processing chain has been implemented to extract lake ice coverage and lake ice phenology for lakes as small as 0.05 km² using machine learning classification models. Accuracy assessments using webcam-based ground observations demonstrate that the system can extract phenological key dates with high precision, achieving an R² of 0.98 and a mean absolute error of 0.17 ± 4.3 (1σ) days.</p>

    <h3>Where to access the data?</h3>
    <p>The lake ice data is accessible through our web application, which allows users to explore lake ice coverage and phenological event dates for over 1,200 lakes across the European Alps. The application also includes an integrated feature that provides a preview of the satellite imagery used as input for the selected data points.</p>
